# PROJECT-COVID19
Topic: Data of businesses negatively affected by the epidemic and closed

Detailed Description: 

  While the population affected by the COVID-19 virus continues to increase rapidly, we do not yet have any evidence that the virus is under control. Worldwide, the concern created by the global epidemic is increasing and businesses are seriously affected by this situation. Employees are encouraged to work from home whenever possible, shopping malls and restaurants are closing, and travel and tourism revenues collapse on a global scale. While global supply chains are seriously affected, it is observed that production has been completely stopped in some sectors, especially automotive. It can be said that almost all sectors are negatively affected by the process. These prominent sectors are; transportation (airlines, bus companies), service (hotels, restaurants, accommodation services), retail,
especially those with complex supply chains are manufacturers. 
 
 The number of businesses closing down with the Covid 19 outbreak in the world is increasing day by day. In this project, there are data of businesses that have been adversely affected by the Covid 19 outbreak in Turkey and decided to close. These data will be accessed through the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB).
