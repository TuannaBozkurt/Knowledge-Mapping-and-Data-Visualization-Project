- Businesses that lost revenue and shut down with the Covid-19 outbreak
 
### INTRODUCTION
 _Around the world, the anxiety caused by the global epidemic is increasing and businesses are being severely affected. There are many businesses that have been negatively affected by the pandemic and decided to close. Employees are encouraged to work from home whenever possible, shopping malls and restaurants are closing, and travel and tourism revenues are collapsing on a global scale. While global supply chains are severely affected, it is seen that production is completely stopped in some sectors, especially in automotive.It can be said that almost all industries are adversely affected by this process._
