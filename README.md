### INTRODUCTION
 _Around the world, the anxiety caused by the global epidemic is increasing and businesses are being severely affected. There are many businesses that have been negatively affected by the pandemic and decided to close. Employees are encouraged to work from home whenever possible, shopping malls and restaurants are closing, and travel and tourism revenues are collapsing on a global scale.
